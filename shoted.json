  "character_description": "A stunningly handsome Chinese man in his late 20s, with sharp yet gentle facial features, pale flawless skin, and profound dark eyes. He has long black hair partially tied up in a loose bun at the back of his head, with several strands falling naturally around his face. He wears elegant ink-wash gradient linen robes in shades of charcoal gray and off-white, with flowing brushstroke patterns. The robes feature wide sleeves that billow in the wind. The overall aesthetic is ethereal, combining traditional Chinese elements with modern xianxia fantasy style. Full body shot, cinematic lighting, soft morning light, highly detailed, photorealistic, 8K resolution.",
